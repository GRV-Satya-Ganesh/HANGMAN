<p>Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where player tries to guess the word (which is selected randomly by the computer) by suggesting letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is placed in the correct positions on the blank line. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the computer starts drawing a stick figure (the hangman) on a separate part of the board. Each incorrect guess adds another part to the figure (head, body, arms, legs). </p>
<p>The player wins if they correctly guess the word before the hangman figure is complete. The player loose if the hangman figure is completed before the player guesses the word. In this the random that are selected are from the bike companies like Yamaha, BMW , etc. Hope you will enjoy the game. Thank you.</p>
